#### Questions

> What is a Node module?

A: A set of functions that we want to include in our application. Modules typically contain functions that are similar in nature (e.g. such as working with files, or adding animation).

> What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A: `module.exports` is an object used to export functions. `exports` is a reference to `module.exports` and is recommended to be used in your modules, but you can use both interchangably. 


> Why is using exports recommended?

A: Using `exports` avoids accidently reassigning `module.exports` and losing the functions you need for your application.
